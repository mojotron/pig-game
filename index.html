      <ul>
        <li>First player to reach 100 points, wins the game!</li>
        <li>
          Roll the 20 sided dice, roll value will be added to your current
          score. But some values have special rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold button, add your current score to your total score, then pass
          turn to your opponent.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you roll 1, its critical fail, you loose all your total points and
          other player has turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rolling 2, you loose current points, opponents turn to roll d20.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rolling 3 is a bad one, opponent takes your current score and increase
          his/her score. And if that isn't enough you lose your turn. Bad bad
          number!
        </li>
        <li>
          19 coolest of them all, you take your current score from opponents
          total score and add it to your total score. You are still rolling but
          you loose current score. This roll can be game changer!
        </li>
        <li>
          Natural 20 or critical hit, your current score is doubled! Great time
          to press that hold button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other numbers makes your current score bigger, don't wait to long for
          pressing hold button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reset button, really you want explanation, ok ok, reset game and play
          from beginning all score fields are 0 dah!
        </li>
      </ul>

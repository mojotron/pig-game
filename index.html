      <ul>
        <li>First player to reach 500 points win the game!</li>
        <li>
          Roll the 20 sided dice, value from the roll will be added to your
          current score. But sone values have special rules.
        </li>
        <li>Hold button, takes you current score and add it to your score.</li>
        <li>
          If you roll 1, its critical fail, you lose all points and other player
          has turn.
        </li>
        <li>Rolling 2, you loose current points, opponent turn to roll.</li>
        <li>
          Rolling 3 is a bad one, opponent takes your current score and increase
          his/her score. And if that isnt enough you lose your turn. Bad bad
          number!
        </li>
        <li>
          This is if you ask me best value, you take current score from oponents
          score and add it to your score. But you loose your current soce and
          you still rolling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Critical hit, your current score is doubled! Great time to press that
          hold button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other numbers makes your current score bigger, don't wait to long for
          pressing hold button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reset button, really you want explanation, ok ok, reset game and play
          from beginning all score fields are 0 dah!
        </li>
      </ul>

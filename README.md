# Pig Game

This project is inspired by awesome tutorial [Complete Javascript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann and
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
Goal of this project is reinforce my knowledge at the current learning path.

## What have I learned?

- Dynamically update DOM element depending on state variables. Using one variable (current player) to update score end multiple DOM elements.
- Activate/Deactivate event listeners depending on game state. When initialize new game activate roll and hold button and when end game is reached deactivate those buttons so player cannot use them until start of next new game.
- Init function for setting up starting state. Making code DRY.
- Not depending on global flag variables to change game state
